# MemPalace MCP tools

The MCP server exposes ~30 tools, all prefixed `mempalace_*`. Discoverable via the MCP `list-tools` capability — the count and surface may grow.

> **Discover the schema; never call a write tool from memory.** These tools are deferred/lazy-loaded in most harnesses: their parameter schemas are **not** in your context until you search for them. The table below lists each tool's *purpose only* — deliberately not its parameters, because hand-copied signatures drift as the surface grows. **Before your first call to any `mempalace_*` write tool in a session, run the harness tool-search on that exact tool name** (e.g. `tool_search` / the deferred-tool lookup). That surfaces the tool's live JSON schema — required fields, optional fields, exact names — which you then copy verbatim. The write tools have non-obvious required fields and reject unknown params, so guessing from the prose here will fail on the first call. See [Known first-call gotchas](#known-first-call-gotchas) for why guessing goes wrong.

## Known first-call gotchas

You don't need these if you discover the schema first — but they explain the failure mode. Prose about "drawers", "facts", and "diary entries" tends to prime three wrong guesses:

- `add_drawer` — models invent a `title` param. There is none; the searchable lead line goes inside `content`.
- `kg_add` — models pass `fact` (colliding with other tools' `fact` param) or `source`. It's a triple: `subject` / `predicate` / `object`, with provenance under `source_file` / `source_drawer_id` / `source_closet`.
- `diary_write` — models omit `agent_name`, assuming the wing is derived. `agent_name` is required.

The fix for all three is the same: run tool-search first and read the real schema.

## Palace — read

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_status` | Palace status & stats (wings/rooms/drawers) |
| `mempalace_list_wings` | List all wings |
| `mempalace_list_rooms` | List rooms in a wing |
| `mempalace_list_drawers` | List drawers in a wing/room |
| `mempalace_get_drawer` | Fetch a single drawer by id |
| `mempalace_get_taxonomy` | Full wing/room/drawer tree |
| `mempalace_search` | Semantic search (args: `query`, optional `wing`, `room`) |
| `mempalace_check_duplicate` | Check whether a memory already exists before adding |
| `mempalace_memories_filed_away` | Recently-filed drawer summary |
| `mempalace_get_aaak_spec` | Retrieve the AAAK compression dialect spec |

## Palace — write

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_add_drawer` | Add a new memory (drawer) |
| `mempalace_update_drawer` | Update an existing drawer in place |
| `mempalace_delete_drawer` | Delete a memory (drawer) |

## Tunnels (cross-wing connections)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_list_tunnels` | List all tunnels |
| `mempalace_find_tunnels` | Find tunnels between two wings |
| `mempalace_create_tunnel` | Add a tunnel (room↔room across wings) |
| `mempalace_delete_tunnel` | Remove a tunnel |
| `mempalace_follow_tunnels` | Traverse tunnels from a room |
| `mempalace_traverse` | Walk halls + tunnels from a room |
| `mempalace_graph_stats` | Connectivity stats |

## Knowledge Graph (triples)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_kg_query` | Query KG triples |
| `mempalace_kg_add` | Add a triple |
| `mempalace_kg_invalidate` | Invalidate a triple (soft-delete with timestamp) |
| `mempalace_kg_timeline` | View triple lifecycle history |
| `mempalace_kg_stats` | Triple/entity/relationship counts |

## Agent diary

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_diary_write` | Persist a diary entry (per-agent journal) |
| `mempalace_diary_read` | Read prior diary entries |

## Native coordination versus tracked tasks

| Native tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_task_create` | Immutable addressed delegation request and handoff |
| `mempalace_event_append` | Append a coordination event |
| `mempalace_event_list` | Read coordination events; negotiate append-order cursor behavior |
| `mempalace_event_ack` | Append an acknowledgment; does not enforce exclusive ownership |
| `mempalace_artifact_put` / `mempalace_artifact_get` | Store/retrieve exact supporting artifacts |

The optional **task sidecar** is a separate MCP registration with `mptask_*`
tools. It adds authoritative lifecycle, graph publication, claim/lease and
recovery invariants over a reserved logstream. Do not substitute the native
delegation/ack tools for sidecar claims, or infer readiness from semantic search.
Discover the sidecar's live schemas and invoke its `mempalace-tasks` safety skill.
Read-only human inspection is available through the sidecar CLI.

## Maintenance

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mempalace_sync` | Prune drawers whose source files are gitignored/deleted |
| `mempalace_reconnect` | Re-open the chroma client (after drift) |
| `mempalace_hook_settings` | Inspect/adjust auto-save hook configuration |
